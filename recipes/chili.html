        <p>I love chili. My mother used to make it, and I think about it every day. I will forego some story about how she immigrated to this country with only the clotrhes on her back and this recipe in her pocket. Let's get to the recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </h2>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes with juice. If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol>
