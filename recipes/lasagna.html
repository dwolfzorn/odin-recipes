        <p>I love lasagna. My mother used to make it, and I think about it every day. I will forego some story about how she immigrated to this country with only the clotrhes on her back and this recipe in her pocket. Let's get to the recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
                <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
                <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lasagna Noodles/ Cheese Topping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
                <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </h2>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol>
