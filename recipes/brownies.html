        <p>I love brownies. My mother used to make it, and I think about it every day. I will forego some story about how she immigrated to this country with only the clotrhes on her back and this recipe in her pocket. Let's get to the recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup butter,</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup favorite adds-ins, (chopped dark chocolate, chocolate chips or walnut)</li>
            </ul>
        </h2>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 350F. Grease an 8x8 square pan or a 9x5 loaf pan or line with parchment or foil; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, add the butter and microwave for 1 minute or until completely melted. Add the sugar and cocoa powder and whisk vigorously for at least a minute, until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time then vanilla and whisk for at least 1 minute, until well combined and batter is shiny.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour and salt until the flour is fully combined. Be careful not to overmix mix.</li>
            <li>(optional) fold in 1/2 cup of nuts, raisins, chocolate chips or anything you desire.</li>
            <li>Spread in pan and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until the center is slightly set.  Be careful not to over-bake!</li>
            <li>Cool completely then cut into 9 large squares or 16 small squares ( I cut mine into 16)</li>
        </ol>
